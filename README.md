# AP Course and Exam Description Text Formatter Website

The site itself: https://why-am.github.io/ap-ced-formatter-website

Created to format text copied from College Board AP CED PDFs. They usually contain newlines and weird whitespace characters that make it hard to use elsewhere.

Vibecoding was involved.
